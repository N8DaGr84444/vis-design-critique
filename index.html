        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>This visualization was created to help visualize the rapid spread and record breaking case rates of the omicron wave, and it's progression across the country. 
            When looking at a graph of overall cases in the US, it appears that omicron was declining just as fast as it spread. However, by looking at each state, this is not
            always the case. Some states still have an increasing amount of cases. This visualization allows for state-by-state comparisons and a more detailed look into the trends
            of omicron. It also compares the trends and current rates of omnicron to other variants of coronavirus. 
        </p>
        <p>Due to the national interest in coronavirus, this visualization is for everyone from medical professionals to a curious mother. It helps people identify trends that could
            be challenging to notice just by the raw data, and it also allows for a deeper look into the data, as opposed to just viewing the trends of the United States as a whole.
            Users can find their home state on the map and learn what the status of omicron there, and how many cases there are compared to neighboring states and the country as a whole.
            They can also compare the trend of their region to other regions in the country. The visualization also provides a chart of upward trending states as well as a chart of downward
            trending states, so a user can still determine the condition of their state without having to find it on a map.
